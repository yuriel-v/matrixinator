# The Matrixinator v0.6 (beta)
The Matrixinator is a small utility I made for my lab assistant Joshu.

He once asked me about an application that could help him predict 8 values,
named BS22, BS15, BS3, BS8, BS27, BS84, BS18 and BS278. These would be
calculated off a similarity matrix generated from a similarity dendrogram.

So, being the kind soul I am, I offered my help and thus developed this utility
in C++ for him to use in his lab. It doesn't seem like he understand the language
this program is written in... so he's attempting to recreate it in Python.

Future plans include:
-> An automatic way of finding .xml and .csv files for use (through boost.filesystem);
-> Getting started on the Python version of this, kindly nicknamed "The Pythrixinator".
